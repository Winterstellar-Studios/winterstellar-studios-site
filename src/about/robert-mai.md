name: Robert Mai
bio: >-
  Robert Mai grew up in Orange County, CA, chasing a dream of creating art from
  a very young age. He played in several orchestras as a teenager and
  transcribed performances to build his musical knowledge. In college, he
  studied film writing and production at Chapman University. After several years
  of trying different professions, Robert found a passion and a knack for
  composing, which combined two of his great loves: film and music.\

  \

  Thanks to his dedication (and luck!), Robert has more than 5 years of experience in the industry and is still going strong. His work spans many genres in over one hundred projects, resulting in a variety of international awards for his music and credits with Showtime, Netflix, Ubisoft, and Amazon. Robert was also recently honored with remarkably official membership in BAFTA and the Grammy Recording Academy.\

  \

  As a composer, Robert draws from a variety of inspirations including Jerry Goldsmith, Jonny Greenwood, Joe Hisaishi, Ennio Morricone, and Grant Kirkhope. (He’d also like to list John Williams, but can anyone approach the master?) He enjoys creating for all kinds of mediums, including film, video games, television, podcasts, and more. Robert has a special love of composing for animation, and enjoys mentoring young composers in his spare time.\

  \

  Robert usually lurks in his studio, practicing the ocarina and working on his latest project. When you can pry him away from his work, he also enjoys cooking, painting, wood engraving, hiking, and foolishly running in marathons well beyond his endurance level. If you’re looking for a creative, collaborative musical partner, don’t hesitate to reach out to discuss your project!
