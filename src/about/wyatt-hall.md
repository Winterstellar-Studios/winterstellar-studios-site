  ##### Wyatt Hall - Founder and creative director


  Wyatt fell in love with filmmaking at a young age, but growing up a world apart from other film people, he quickly adopted a “if you want it done, you gotta figure it out” mindset. This drove him to learn Visual Effects and Animation, which quickly became his primary passions. Wyatt has Produced and Directed several short films over the years, both animated and live action. His films have screened at festivals worldwide and in 2020 he was won a “Best Director” award for his work on *The Runaway*.
